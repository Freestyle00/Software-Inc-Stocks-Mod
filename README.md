# Stocks Pro mod

A mod that adds a unified overview for company stocks.

## Overview

The base game does not offer a single, consolidated view of all company stocks.  
This mod introduces a dedicated UI that aggregates stock-related information across companies into a single list.

The mod exposes stock interactions directly from this overview and is intended to expand over time. Planned features include stock shorting, which will introduce mechanics not currently available in the base game.

Unfortunately the linegraph only shows the company balances the last 24 Months (This number can be changed I plan to make it configurable in the near future) because company worth data is not being saved historically.

I also plan to add an option to short stocks in the near future.
